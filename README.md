- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RichardHorvatich
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full-stack web development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on front-end web design and UI. I like building and designing smooth, appealing websites. HTML Email templates are a focus of mine and there        will be a lot of this on here.I also do freelance web development. 
- I have some experience with python and data structures but I am still relatively new.
- All my projects will have a link to the active version in the readme. It should be below all project files for every project as well.
