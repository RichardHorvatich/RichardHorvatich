- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RichardHorvatich
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full-stack web development. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focused on front-end web design and UI. I like building and designing smooth, appealing websites. I also do freelance web development. 
- I have some experience with python and data structures but I am still relatively new. I have put together some professional websites and I am definitely 
- starting to aquire some skills. I plan to load on here my Fitness business website, a freelance website, and some other projects. Once I have them loaded 
- on GitHub, I will likely update this readme.
